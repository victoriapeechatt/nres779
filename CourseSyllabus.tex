\subsection*{Course Description:}
Virtually all progress is science requires using models to gain
insight from data. This course will focus on gaining insight of
scientific processes using statistics, mathematics, and
observation. We will first review necessary probability, statistics,
and computing, and then focus on Bayesian model building and
implementation. The review at the beginning is primarily meant to get
everyone on the same page in terms of notation and to highlight the
most important aspects of the prerequisites. The data used in
applications will focus on ecological applications. However, many of
the concepts and models are transferable to other areas of natural
resources and environmental science, including evolution, and
conservation biology. Example data sets will include: wildlife and
plant surveys, presence-absence (occupancy) data,
mark-recapture/re-sight data, GPS animal movement data, and physical
and chemical process data. We will discuss spatial and temporal
aspects of analysis, including models for spatial and temporal
autocorrelation. We will strive to discuss methods that are generally
applicable to all areas of natural resource and environmental
science. Students should have access to their own computer and a
working installation of R.

\subsection*{Course prerequisites}
\subsubsection*{Required prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
\item Working knowledge of \texttt{R}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Suggested prerequisites}
Although not necessary, students with a course in calculus, linear
algebra (MATH 330), and one of the following
courses
\begin{itemize}
\item STAT 429/629,
\item STAT 461/661,
\item NRES 746,
\end{itemize}
will get the most out of the course. None of these are absolute
requirements; I will review key background concepts as part of the
lectures. However, that said, if you don't have at least two of these
background courses, you should be prepared to do some remedial work on
your own.

\section*{Student learning outcomes:}
\textbf{Students will be able to:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Learn the basic principles of probability and statistical
  distributions needed to link deterministic models to data and apply these to a number of real data sets.
\item Explain maximum likelihood methods for estimating parameters in
  ecological models.
\item Explain key principles of Bayesian statistics. Understand the
  relationship between inference accomplished by maximum likelihood
  and by applying Bayesâ€™ theorem.
\item Diagram, write, and implement hierarchical models
  appropriate for diverse problems in ecological and natural resource science.
\item Explain how Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods can be used
  to approximate marginal posterior distributions. Write MCMC
  algorithms and computer code in \texttt{R} implementing MCMC methods
  for simple Bayesian models.
\item Use software for implementing MCMC methods (i.e., JAGS, R
  packages) to approximate marginal posterior distributions of
  parameters, latent variables, and derived quantities of interest. Be
  able to evaluate convergence.
\item Apply procedures for model checking and model selection in
  the Bayesian framework.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Grading criteria, scale, and standards}

\noindent Grades will be based on an occasional quiz as well as a
sequence of approximately 8-12 labs that may involve
short-answer, essay, mathematical derivations, computer programming,
data analysis, and paper summary/discussion.

\begin{itemize}
\item Reports must be prepared using some form of \TeX language.
\item Reports will be prepared by rotating pair groups.
\item By the end of the day that reports are due, each group member
  must email me a brief description of their collaborator's strengths
  (why this person is a good collaborator). These reports will be
  compiled and used to determine a collaborator-score that will
  account for 20\% of the course grade. These emails will be kept
  anonymous.
\item The \texttt{R} software will be used for all statistical
  analysis and code/functions should be attached to the report as an
  appendix.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Grading Policy:} Homework and quizzes (80\%),
participation and group collaboration (20\%).

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ lllll }
    89.5\% & $<$ & A  &      &\\ 
    87\%   & $<$ & B+ &$\leq$& 89.5\%\\

\section*{Classroom Civility}
To create and preserve a classroom atmosphere that optimizes teaching and learning, all students share the responsibility of creating a positive learning environment. Students are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that does not disrupt teaching or learning, and they are expected to follow these standards:
\begin{itemize}
\item First and foremost, classroom discussion should be civilized, inclusive, and respectful to everyone! Disagreement is expected. Intolerance will not be permitted!
\item You are expected to be on time. I intend to begin class promptly at the designated time, and you should be in your seat and ready to begin class at this time. Class ends at the designated time. Please refrain from packing up your belongings early. It is disruptive to me and, more importantly, to your fellow students.
\item Classroom participation is a part of your grade in this course. You must attend class prepared to fully participate. 
\item Classroom discussion is meant to allow us to hear a variety of viewpoints. This can only happen if we respect each other and our differences.
\item Cell phones must be turned off during class, unless you have informed me ahead of time that you are expecting an emergency message.
\item Students that engage in high-level distractions will be asked to leave class. 
\end{itemize}

Resources and interim measures are available to assist you. For more information, please visit: https://www.unr.edu/equal-opportunity-title-ix .


\section*{Unique class procedures/ structures:}
\subsection*{Working in groups:} You will be assigned a lab group
with another colleague every week. A team approach to work in
the laboratories allows you to teach each other as well as to learn
from me. It will lighten the work load by allowing you to share
tasks. It is more fun.

\subsection*{EECB Diversity Statement}
We, the EECB faculty and students of the University of Nevada, Reno, condemn all forms of discrimination and recognize that systemic bias is pervasive in academia. EECB fully supports the goals of Black Lives Matter, DiversifySTEM, QueerSTEM, DiversifyEEB, Black Ecologists Matter, and allied groups.

We recognize that systemic anti-Blackness, racism, sexism, xenophobia, and transphobia have contributed substantially to a lack of diversity in EECB fields, and we support all individuals and organizations working towards correcting these injustices. We commit to holding ourselves accountable for recognizing and eliminating systemic discrimination within our unit with regards to race, ethnicity, national origins, immigration status, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, ability, socioeconomic status, and religion. We commit ourselves to identifying and dismantling the barriers to accessibility and full participation in our disciplines because we recognize that the greatest scientific advancements will require the full scope of human creativity and experience. We commit to being an active participant and leader in the substantial review and renewal that is needed in education, research and academic policies related to student and faculty equity. Some solutions are within our immediate reach, while others require developing policies and practices that can only be implemented at higher administrative levels or in partnership with our surrounding community. We commit to the long-term work required to develop and implement these actions on our campus, in our local community, as well as our broader scientific societies.
