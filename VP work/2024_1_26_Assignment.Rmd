#### Nicholsonâ€“Bailey model:

This model is spin off of the Lotka-Volterra model which describes competitive and mutualistic interactions between two populations. The Nicholson-Bailey model is specific to host-parasitoid interactions. My study system includes the specialist herbivore (*Euphydryas phaeton*) and its specialist parasitoid (*Cotesia euphydryas*), and I hope to use this model to understand their dynamics with variable stressors. I also possibly want to expand it to include interactions between other trophic levels. (the host plant below the herbivore and the hyper-parasitoid above the parasitoid)

```{=tex}
\begin{equation*}
H_{t+1} = H_te^{r(1-H_t/K)}e^{-aP_t}
\end{equation*}
```
```{=tex}
\begin{equation*}
P_{t+1} = cH_t(1-e^{-aP_t})
\end{equation*}
```
$H$: population size of the host

$P$: population size of the parasitoid

$r$: reproductive rate of the host

$K$: carrying capacity of the host

$a$: attack rate of the parasitoid

$c$: average number of viable eggs the parasitoid lays in a host

Assumptions of the model include 1 - the parasitoid finds hosts randomly and 2 - the hosts and parasitoids are randomly distributed across a landscape. $e^{r(1-H_t/K)}$ is the rate of population growth for the host in a density dependent context and $e^{-aP_t}$ is the probability that the host will survive. $\therefore$ $(1-e^{-aP_t})$ is the probability that the parasitoid survives.
